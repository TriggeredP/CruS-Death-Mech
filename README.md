# Cruelty Squad Death Mech Mod

## Description
This is a modification for the Cruelty Squad that adds a combat mech to the game
The mech has two miniguns and 2000 health points

## Install
To install mod, you will need the [Cruelty Squad Mod Loader](https://github.com/CruS-Modding-Infrastructure/crus-modloader)
Then download the file from the release and unzip it along the way:
`%appdata%\Godot\app_userdata\Cruelty Squad\mods\`

## Usage
Press T to throw a beacon grenade
You need $2000 to rent a mech

Press R on the mech to enter it
Press again to exit

The left and right mouse buttons are used to shoot miniguns
If you lose your mech, you will be charged a fine, so be careful

You can change it there:

I will try to fix it in the future
